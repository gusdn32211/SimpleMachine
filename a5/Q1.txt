1a. The difference between using the stack and register approach is that the register does not call ping by pushing the return address on stack.
    It directly returns ping when called. The stack appoarch gets a return value after the stack deallocates space.

1b. A benefit for using the stack approach is that it can store multiple values of return address for programs that calls multiple functions
    that needs returns. Unlike the register approach, the stack approach can access all the values without overriding.

1c. A benefit for using the register approach is that the whole process happens a lot faster and simpler than the stack approach.
